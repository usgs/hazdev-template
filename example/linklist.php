      <p>On August 23, 2011 tens of millions of people along the East Coast of
        the U.S from Maine to Georgia, west to Cincinnati, Cleveland, and
        Chicago, and southeastern Canada suddenly felt the earth shaking from
        the largest earthquake in the eastern U.S. since the M5.8 earthquake in
        1944 near Cornwall and Massena, New York. What have scientists learned
        from this rare earthquake?

      <h4>Was the M5.3 Trinidad, CO Earthquake Natural or Induced?</h4>
      <p>A magnitude 5.3 earthquake occurred near Trinidad, Colorado in the
        Raton Basin on August of 2011. A previous study by USGS scientists of
        smaller earthquakes in the area had concluded that the Raton Basin was
        experiencing a significant increase in the number of earthquakes
        starting in 2001 after an increase in hydrocarbon production activity
        starting in 1999. The M5.3 Trinidad earthquake provided another
        important piece to the puzzle.

      <h4>How Big and How Frequent Are Earthquakes on the Wasatch Fault?</h4>
      <img src="http://placehold.it/150x150" alt="Placeholder image">
      <p>A team of scientists have been gathering data from new paleoseismic
        trenches along the Wasatch fault zone. These new datasets will help
        researchers to understand if past surface-rupturing earthquakes have
        spanned fault segment boundaries. They are also analyzing new
        high-resolution airborne LiDAR topographic data to characterize
        previously unmapped fault traces and to measure how vertical
        displacements (vertical offset of the ground surface from faulting)
        vary, both in space (from north to south) and time (the last 20,000
        years).
